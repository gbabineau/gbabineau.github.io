Rusty Blackbirds (_Euphagus carolinus_) are a bird that was once common but are now in precipitous decline to to a number of human caused factors. Some reasons are difficult to address and global but others, like mercury poisoning from coal burning power plants, which also poison humans, is more easily addressed by shifting to more environmentally friendly alternatives like solar. This [article](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/news/rusty-blackbirds-are-rising-from-obscurity-but-falling-in-number/) provides more information on the conservation issues and actions.

## Identifying the bird

A great description can be found [here](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Rusty_Blackbird/id). They are medium size blackbirds with a drooping bill. The breeding male is all black with a pale eye. The bird is described as being Robin sized but one way I have seen them standout is that they are smaller than an American Robin as this image shows. (The Robin is on the left.)

In the non-breeding males and females, the white line above the eye really does stand out.

## When and where to find them in Albemarle County, VA

Information about when they arrive in your county can be found [here](https://ebird.org/barchart?r=US-VA-003&yr=all&m=). Change the county to your own.

In our county they are here in the winter in small flocks. Where I see them is in wet fields and alongside ponds - the pond at Lickinghole creek for example. Yesterday they were part of a mixed flock of 50 robins 20 Red-Winged Blackbirds, 2 Common Grackles and 5 Brown-Headed Cowbirds all probing for food in a field grazed by horses behind our house. I have seen them there before and it seems like the wetter the better! They even like a neighbors muddy paddock.

So keep an eye out in wet areas alongside ponds and in wet fields.

## What can you do

* Enter your observations in [eBird](https://ebird.org/home) as conservation of this bird relies on knowledge of their habits.
* Vote for representatives who will address the factors leading the decline.
* Adopt bird-friendly landscaping practices. (e.g no pesticides and herbicides).
