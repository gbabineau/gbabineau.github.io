title: June 9, 2020, Atlassing Buchanan County, Part 3, The Results
---

National events ended up taking on a larger role than anticipated on this trip. Be sure to see [Part 1](2020-06-06-Atlassing-Buchanan-County.md). See also a [Project Introduction](2020-06-07-Project-Introduction.md). In this post I will share the results of the project.

This table summarizes the results. My objective was to complete the first 3. They were all accepted as complete so success!

| Block | Prior Daytime Effort (hrs) | Prior Breeding Species | Prior % Prob+Confirmed | Final Daytime Effort(hrs) | Final Breeding Species | Final % Probable+Confirmed | Nightjar Survey |
| ------------ | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| Bradshaw SE  | 0.47 | 28 | 18% |  9.26 | 60 | 77% | yes |
| Harman SE    | 1.9  | 45 | 22% | 20.68| 73 | 62% | yes |
| Patterson SE | 2.8  | 61 | 46% |  8.3 | 69 | *49%* | *NA* |
| *Prater SE*  | 1.63 | 27 | 19% |  5.1 | 48 | *48%* | np |

*The Patterson SE block has additional data from another surveyor which is why it is completed without meeting the percentage requirement.*
