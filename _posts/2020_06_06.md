A great description can be found [here](https://www.allaboutbirds.org/guide/Rusty_Blackbird/id). They are medium size blackbirds with a drooping bill. The breeding male is all black with a pale eye. The bird is described as being Robin sized but one way I have seen them standout is that they are smaller than an American Robin as this image shows. (The Robin is on the left.)
